## scMiko

scMiko is an **R package** developed for single-cell RNA-seq analysis. It was designed using the [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) framework, and offers existing and novel single-cell analytic work flows. 

Documentation and tutorials can be found at [https://nmikolajewicz.github.io/scMiko/](https://nmikolajewicz.github.io/scMiko/). To get started, refer to our [getting started with scMiko](https://nmikolajewicz.github.io/scMiko/articles/install.html) article. 

scMiko is hosted on Github, and the source code can be cloned at [https://github.com/NMikolajewicz/scMiko](https://github.com/NMikolajewicz/scMiko).

scMiko is developed and tested in Windows, however it is expected to work in MacOS X and Linux. 

## scPipeline

The scPipeline analysis pipeline is a modular **collection of R markdown scripts** that have been developed in tandem with the scMiko package. The scPipeline pipeline generates dashboard reports for scRNAseq analyses. 

Documentation and tutorials for scPipeline workflows can also be found at [https://nmikolajewicz.github.io/scMiko/](https://nmikolajewicz.github.io/scMiko/). To get started, see our [getting started with scPipeline](https://nmikolajewicz.github.io/scMiko/articles/scPipeline_getting_started.html) article.
